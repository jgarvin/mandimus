#Mandimus
Mandimus is a speech recognizer that will run commands when a user speaks preset sentences.

##Requirements
1. pocketsphinx
2. gstreamer-0.10 (and what ever plugin has pocket sphinx support)
3. gstreamer-0.10 base plugins (required for alsa)
4. pyside (only required for the Qt based UI)
5. pygtk (only required for the Gtk based UI)

##Usage
0. move commands.tmp to ~/.config/mandimus/commands.conf and fill the file with sentences and command to run
1. Run Mandimus.py, this will generate ~/.config/mandimus/sentences.corpus based on sentences in the 'commands' file
2. quit mandimus (there is a good chance it will just segfault)
3. go to <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html> and upload the sentences.corpus file
4. download the resulting XXXX.lm file to the ~/.config/mandimus/language directory and rename to file to 'lm'
5. download the resulting XXXX.dic file to the ~/.config/mandimus/language directory and rename to file to 'dic'
6. run Mandimus.py
    * for Qt GUI, run Mandimus.py -i q
    * for Gtk GUI, run Mandimus.py -i g
    * to start a UI in 'continuous' listen mode, use the -c flag
    * to use a microphone other than the system default, use the -d flag
7. start talking

####Bonus
once the sentences.corpus file has been created, run the language_updater.sh script to automate the process of creating and downloading language files.

####Examples
To run mandimus with the GTK UI and start in continuous listen mode:
./mandimus.py -i g -c

To run mandimus with no UI and using a USB microphone recognized and device 2:
./mandimus.py -d 2

####Finding the Device Number of a USB microphone
There are a few ways to find the device number of a USB microphone.

* `cat /proc/asound/cards`
* `arecord -l`
